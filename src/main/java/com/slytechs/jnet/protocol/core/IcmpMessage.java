/**
 * Interface for all Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The ICMP message header is a 8-byte header that is used to carry ICMP
 * messages. It is located immediately after the IPv4 or IPv6 header. The ICMP
 * message header contains the following fields:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Type:</b> This field identifies the type of ICMP message. There are
 * many different types of ICMP messages, each with its own purpose.</li>
 * <li><b>Code:</b> This field provides additional information about the ICMP
 * message. The meaning of the code field depends on the type of ICMP message.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Checksum:</b> This field is used to verify the integrity of the ICMP
 * message. The checksum is calculated over the entire ICMP message, including
 * the header and the data.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following table lists some of the most common types of ICMP messages:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Echo Request:</b> This message is used to request a response from a
 * remote host.</li>
 * <li><b>Echo Reply:</b> This message is used to respond to an Echo Request
 * message.</li>
 * <li><b>Destination Unreachable:</b> This message is used to indicate that a
 * packet could not be delivered to its destination.</li>
 * <li><b>Time Exceeded:</b> This message is used to indicate that a packet
 * exceeded its TTL (Time to Live).</li>
 * <li><b>Parameter Problem:</b> This message is used to indicate that a packet
 * contained an invalid IP header field.</li>
 * </ul>

	 * field, and then taking the one's complement of the result.
