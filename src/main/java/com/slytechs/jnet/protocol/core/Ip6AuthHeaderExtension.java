/**
 * IPv6 authentication extension header (AH).
 * <p>
 * The IPv6 authentication header (AH) is an extension header that provides
 * connectionless integrity and data origin authentication for IPv6 packets. The
 * AH can also provide protection against packet replays.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AH is used by the sender to calculate an authentication value (AV) for
 * the packet. The AV is calculated over the following fields:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The IPv6 header</li>
 * <li>The extension headers that precede the AH</li>
 * <li>The upper-layer protocol data</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The AV is then placed in the AH. When the packet is received, the receiver
 * calculates its own AV for the packet. If the receiver's AV does not match the
 * AV in the AH, the packet is discarded.
 * </p>
