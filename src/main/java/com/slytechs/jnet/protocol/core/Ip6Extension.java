/**
 * Interface for all IPv6 extension headers to access extension length and next
 * header type fields.
 * <p>
 * IPv6 extension headers are a set of optional headers that can be used to
 * carry additional information with an IPv6 packet. They are placed between the
 * fixed IPv6 header and the upper-layer protocol header. Extension headers form
 * a chain, using the Next Header field. The Next Header field in the fixed
 * header indicates the type of the first extension header; the Next Header
 * field of the last extension header indicates the type of the upper-layer
 * protocol header in the payload of the packet. All extension headers are a
 * multiple of 8 octets in size; some extension headers require internal padding
 * to meet this requirement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are several different types of IPv6 extension headers, each with its
 * own purpose. Some of the most common extension headers include:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Routing header:</b> This header is used to specify a list of one or
 * more intermediate nodes that the packet must pass through before reaching its
 * destination.</li>
 * <li><b>Fragmentation header:</b> This header is used to fragment a large
 * packet into smaller packets that can be forwarded through smaller network
 * links.</li>
 * <li><b>Authentication header:</b> This header is used to provide
 * authentication and integrity for an IPv6 packet.</li>
 * <li><b>Encapsulation header:</b> This header is used to encapsulate an IPv6
 * packet within another protocol, such as IPsec.</li>
 * <li><b>Destination options header:</b> This header is used to carry optional
 * information that is only intended for the destination node.</li>
 * </ul>
