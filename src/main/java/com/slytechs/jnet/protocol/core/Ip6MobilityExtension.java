/**
 * IPv4 mobility extension header.
 * <p>
 * The IPv6 mobility header is an extension header that is used to support
 * mobility for mobile nodes in IPv6 networks. The mobility header is used to
 * carry information about the mobile node's current location and its home
 * address. This information is used by the home agent to tunnel packets to the
 * mobile node, even if the mobile node is not currently located at its home
 * network.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The mobility header is used by the mobile node to send Binding Updates to the
 * home agent. A Binding Update is a message that is used to inform the home
 * agent of the mobile node's current location. The home agent uses the
 * information in the Binding Update to tunnel packets to the mobile node, even
 * if the mobile node is not currently located at its home network.
