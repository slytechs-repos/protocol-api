/**
 * DiffServ, or Differentiated Services.
 * 
 * </p>
 * DiffServ, or Differentiated Services, is a network architecture that
 * specifies a mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and
 * providing quality of service (QoS) on modern IP networks. DiffServ can, for
 * example, be used to provide low-latency to critical network traffic such as
 * voice or streaming media while providing best-effort service to non-critical
 * services such as web traffic or file transfers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * DiffServ uses a 6-bit differentiated services code point (DSCP) in the 8-bit
 * differentiated services field (DS field) in the IP header for packet
 * classification purposes. The DS field replaces the outdated IPv4 TOS field.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The DSCP value can range from 0 to 63, and each value corresponds to a
 * specific type of traffic or a set of traffic characteristics. For example,
 * the DSCP value of 0 is used for best-effort traffic, while the DSCP value of
 * 1 is used for voice traffic.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once a packet has been classified, it is then assigned a per-hop behavior
 * (PHB). The PHB specifies how the packet should be treated by routers and
 * other network devices. For example, a packet with a PHB of EF (which stands
 * for Expedited Forwarding) will be given priority over packets with other
 * PHBs.

	 * <p>

	 * <p>
	 * The DiffServ ECN field is a 2-bit field in the IPv4 header that is used to

	 * routers that a network is becoming congested. This allows routers to take
	 * steps to avoid congestion, such as dropping packets or slowing down the

	 * <p>
	 * The DiffServ ECN field can be used to mark packets in one of two ways:

	 * ECN.</li>
	 * <li>ECN-CE (11): This indicates that the packet has already been marked with
	 * ECN.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * When a router receives a packet that is marked with ECN-CE, the router will
	 * take steps to avoid congestion, such as dropping packets or slowing down the

	 * worse and affecting other packets in the network. *
