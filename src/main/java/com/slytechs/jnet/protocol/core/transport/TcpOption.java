/**
 * Base header class for all TCP options.
 * <p>
 * TCP options are optional fields in the TCP header that can be used to control
 * the behavior of the TCP protocol. There are a number of different TCP
 * options, but some of the most common ones include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Maximum Segment Size (MSS): The MSS option is used to negotiate the
 * maximum size of a TCP segment that can be sent over the connection. This is
 * important because it helps to prevent data from being fragmented, which can
 * lead to performance problems.</li>
 * <li>Window Scale Option: The Window Scale option is used to increase the
 * window size of a TCP connection beyond the default 65,535 bytes. This can be
 * beneficial for connections with high bandwidth and low latency.</li>
 * <li>Selective Acknowledgments (SACK) Option: The SACK option allows the
 * receiver to acknowledge individual segments of data, rather than just the
 * entire window. This can help to improve the performance of TCP connections by
 * reducing the number of retransmissions that are needed.</li>
 * <li>Timestamp Option: The Timestamp option allows the sender and receiver to
 * keep track of the time that data is sent and received. This can be used to
 * help diagnose performance problems and to detect lost or corrupted data.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * TCP options are a valuable tool for improving the performance and reliability
 * of TCP connections. They can be used to control the behavior of the TCP
 * protocol and to adapt the protocol to the specific needs of the network.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here are some additional details about TCP options:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>TCP options are optional fields in the TCP header.</li>
 * <li>TCP options are used to control the behavior of the TCP protocol.</li>
 * <li>There are a number of different TCP options, but some of the most common
 * ones include MSS, Window Scale, SACK, and Timestamp.</li>
 * <li>TCP options can be used to improve the performance and reliability of TCP
 * connections.</li>
